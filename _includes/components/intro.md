Nice to meet you!
This is my tech diary where I'd like to share my notes.
I hope could help.

I'm a proud former member of [Team Digitale](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/), a Governative task force devoted to the digital innovation of my country, my beloved Italy.
In the last 13 years I've worked in the Gambling and Lottery Industry as Tech lead and Software Architect for GCV in Rome.


Mainly I'm a father and an husband. In my spare time I love rock music, reading about motocycles and photograpy.
Science fiction fan in all flavours: films, books, series or comics.
I used to spend my holidays in Arrakys till the rising of Harkonnen.
