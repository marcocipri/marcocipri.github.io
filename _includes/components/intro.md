Nice to meet you!
This is my tech diary where I'd like to share my notes.
I hope could help.

I'm a proud former member of <a title="in HTML.it puoi trovare risorse per webmaster"

Currently I work in the Gambling and Lottery Industry as Tech lead and Software Architect for GCV in Rome.


Mainly I'm a father and an husband.In my spare time I love rock music, reading about motocycles and photograpy.
Science fiction fan in all flavours: films, books, series or comics.
I used to spend my holidays in Arrakys till the rising of Harkonnen.
