**Nice to meet you!**
This is my tech diary where I'd like to share my notes.
I hope could help.

In the last 13 years I've worked in the Gambling and Lottery Industry as Tech lead, Software Architect and Team Leader for [GCV Holding](https://gvc-plc.com/) in Rome.

I'm a proud former member of [Team Digitale](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/), a Governative task force devoted to the digital innovation in Italy, my beloved country. 

Mainly I'm a father and an husband. In my spare time I love rock music, reading about motocycles and photograpy.
Science fiction fan in all flavours: films, books, series or comics.
I used to spend my holidays in Arrakys till the rising of Harkonnen.
